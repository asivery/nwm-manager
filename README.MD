# NWM-manager

This project aims to make it possible to create or edit existing NWM screensaver files for Network Walkman devices.

Currently supported formats:

- NW-A1000 (0xD301)
- NW-E500 (0xEC01) - BITMAP TRANSLATION LOGIC ONLY!

## Contributing

Any and all contributions are welcome. If you want to add support for your device, please refer to the NW-A1000's code to see how to do it. The walkmans' format should be rather similar. All versions should use the 'frames' and 'bitmaps' config keys. Other fields can change.
